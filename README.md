# YourTopMedia - Media Review System

### Description :

Recently have been getting into watching more movies as of late along with the other media I watch such as tv shows and animes, with my main enjoyment coming from hearing/reading different peoples perspectives to see a piece of media from multiple angles and enhancing my understanding. The issue comes in the form that through doing this I sometimes confuse my own thoughts on a piece of media with something someone else read/said. Your Top Media is a full stack media review system that aims solve my problem through the use of the IMDB API, the user would have an array of TV Shows, Movies and Animes to search through, marking their watch history, assign ratings, and craft reviews capturing their initial impressions and thoughts in the purest form.
